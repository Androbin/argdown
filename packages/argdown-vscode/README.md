# Argdown for Visual Studio Code

[Argdown](https://christianvoigt.github.io/argdown) is a simple syntax for analyzing complex argumentation, inspired by Markdown. This extension provides full language support for Argdown in VS Code:

- [Live Preview](#map-preview) of your argument map
- 2 map layout algorithms ([DagreD3](https://github.com/dagrejs/dagre-d3) & [Viz.js](https://github.com/mdaines/viz.js/))
- [Code completion](#code-completion)
- [Symbol search, outline and breadcrumb support](#document-outline-breadcrumbs-and-symbol-search)
- Quick info (hover)
- Folding ranges
- Jump to/peek at references and definitions
- [Syntax highlighting](#activating-the-argdown-theme)
- Linting (Code Diagnostics)
- [Export to Html, Dot, JSON, SVG, PNG and PDF](#exporting)

If you want to learn more about Argdown argumentation syntax, read the [guide and documentation](https://christianvoigt.github.io/argdown).

## Activating the Argdown theme

Standard themes do not highlight Argdown relations and elements. For complete syntax highlighting, please activate the Argdown theme:

1. Go to `Code/Preferences/Color Theme` in the main application menu
2. Select `Argdown Theme` from the list of available themes

The Argdown theme is the default VS Code light theme, enhanced by some Argdown-specific features, so it will also work with other languages.

We hope that VS Code will add support for language-specific themes in the future, so that the Argdown theme will only be active for Argdown files.
