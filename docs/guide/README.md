# Introduction

If you first want to get your feet wet, before jumping right into installing Argdown on your computer, the [Argdown sandbox](https://christianvoigt.github.io/argdown/sandbox/) is the right place for you. Otherwise it is recommended to install [the VS Code extension](/guide/installing-the-vscode-extension.html).

If you prefer to work with a commandline tool instead, you can jump to [installing the Argdown commandline tool](/guide/installing-the-commandline-tool.html).

If you already installed Argdown, we recommend to check out our [example reconstruction](/guide/a-first-example) to get an impression of how it feels to work with Argdown. For a more systematic introduction we recommend to read the [syntax documentation](/syntax/).
