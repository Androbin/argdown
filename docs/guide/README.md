# Introduction

If you first want to get your feet wet, before jumping right into installing Argdown on your computer, the [Argdown sandbox](https://christianvoigt.github.io/argdown/sandbox/) is the right place for you. Otherwise it is recommended to install [the VS Code extension](/guide/installing-the-vscode-extension.html).

If you prefer to work with a commandline tool instead, you can jump to [installing the Argdown commandline tool](/guide/installing-the-commandline-tool.html).
