# A first example

This tutorial will guide you through the reconstruction and visualization of a little debate. It should give you an overview over the main elements of the Argdown syntax and what you can achieve with it. This is not an in-depth explanation of all features of Argdown. Instead this primer tries to give you an impression of how it feels to work with Argdown and introduces you to the basics along the way.

:::tip
Learning by following along an example is an easy and intuitive way of learning. But if you prefer a more systematic approach, we recommend that you immediately start with the [syntax documentation](/syntax/) itself and continue by taking a look at the [creating argument maps](/guide/creating-argument-maps-introduction.html) guide.
